# BLS CPI Inflation Analysis

Hey there! I’m Mike Konczal. This repo is my sandbox for exploring CPI inflation data straight from the BLS. You’ll find R scripts that fetch, clean, and visualize CPI trends—whether it’s core inflation, seasonal adjustments, or policy shock impacts.

## What’s inside?

- **data/**: raw and processed CPI CSV files  
- **scripts/**: R scripts (kick off with `0_run_analysis.R`)  
- **graphics/**: saved plots and charts  
- **legacy/**: older experiments and ideas  

## Quick Start

1. **Clone** this repo.
2. **Install** libraries. Note that my library [govMacroTools](https://github.com/mtkonczal/govMacroTools) needs to be install from that link.
3. **Run** the main analysis.

Dive in, tinker, and let me know what you think! Pull requests and issues are welcome.
